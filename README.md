# tdt4136-a-star
This repository contains my implementation of the A* algorithm for the TDT4136 Introduction to AI course at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

### Background
This project is based on an assignemnt from the course TDT4136 Introduction to AI. The
Map_Obj class is provided by the course and used as a background for the implementation
of A*. The csv-files used as maps are also provided by TDT4136. Code produced by my own
is found in astar.py, visualizer.py and main.py.
